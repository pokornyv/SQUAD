SQUAD
=====
**Description:**
SQUAD (**su**perconducting **qua**ntum **d**ot is a small python code that allows to calculate spectral and transport properties of a single-level quantum dot connected to two BCS superconducting leads.

**Basic features:**
- based on diagrammatic perturbation theory in Coulomb interaction U in Nambu formalism
- calculates properties within the 2nd order perturbation theory ~U^2
- weak-coupling expansion, works well for small U/Gamma
- real-energy axis representation
- direct access to spectral functions and Andreev bound states frequencies
- reliable description of the zero-phase and zero-pi boundary
